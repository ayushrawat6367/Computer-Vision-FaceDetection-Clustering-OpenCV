# Face-Detection & Face Clustering
The project involves two main tasks:

Task 1. Face Detection using OpenCV and Face Recognition Library

Utilizes OpenCV version 4.5.4 for face detection.
Performs face detection on a dataset of images.
Implements face detection in the detect_faces() function in UB_Face.py.
Provides bounding boxes for detected faces in the format [x, y, width, height].

Task2. Face Clustering with K-Means Algorithm

Utilizes the face recognition library for face encodings.
Implements clustering of detected faces using the k-means algorithm.
The number of clusters is determined by K from the input folder.
Implemented in the cluster_faces() function in UB_Face.py
